## Making Changes

Feedback is strongly encouraged. We want this to be helpful and informative whenever possible. If you run into a bug or would like to see a new feature, please open a new issue. Contributions in the form of code (e.g. implementing new features, bug-fixes) are also appreciated. These should follow the "issue -> pull request" workflow:

1. Create an issue for what needs to be done, or could be done better. If you won't be contributing code changes, you can stop here. If you will be contributing code, move to step 2.
2. Create a branch off of the master branch with a name like github_username/issue_24 (replacing github_username with your actual github_username and the issue number with the issue number from the issue you created/submitted)
3. Make and commit your changes locally
4. Push your branch
5. Open a pull request "upstream" with your changes
6. Pull requests should explain clearly what changes have been made, and why they have been made. They should also reference any relevant issues.

## Pushing Changes

1. Create a Pull Request, and assign it to either @ryanmoon or @tgunz
2. Get a beverage from the refrigerator
3. Consume said beverage
4. Profit
